# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
    * I feel fairly confident. The CFU helped clear up some misunderstanding.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
    * They make sense. I will have to continue using them to increase my fluency.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
    * I feel confident with the if statements. I think more practice will help with fluency. I was referencing my notes during a lot of the practice.
1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
    * I spent about 2 hours on this topic. I only planned to spend between and 1 - 1.5 hours, so it took me much longer than I anticipated.
1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
    * I feel the least confident in interpreting what the comparison operators are doing. I am doing to read through that section again before tomorrow's stand up.
1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
    * At the moment I do not have any questions, I just need to practice more.
